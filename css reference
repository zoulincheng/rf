SummaryEDIT
Attribute selectors select an element using the presence of a given attribute or attribute value.

[attr]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr.
[attr=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is exactly "value".
[attr~=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly "value".
[attr|=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr. Its value can be exactly “value” or can begin with “value” immediately followed by “-” (U+002D). It can be used for language subcode matches.
[attr^=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose first value is prefixed by "value".
[attr$=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose last value is suffixed by "value".
[attr*=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value contains at least one occurrence of string "value" as substring.
[attr operator value i]
Adding an i (or I) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).
