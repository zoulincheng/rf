Problem 2: Matching phone numbers
Validating phone numbers is another tricky task depending on the type of input that you get. Having phone numbers from out of the state which require an area code, or international numbers which require a prefix will add complexity to the regular expression, as does the individual preferences that people have for entering phone numbers (some put dashes or whitespace while others do not for example).

Below are a few phone numbers that you might encounter when using real data, write a single regular expressions that matches the number and captures the proper area code.
