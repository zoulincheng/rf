A powerful concept in regular expressions is the ability to match an arbitrary number of characters. For example, imagine that you wrote a form that has a donation field that takes a numerical value in dollars. A wealthy user may drop by and want to donate $25,000, while a normal user may want to donate $25.

One way to express such a pattern would be to use what is known as the Kleene Star and the Kleene Plus, which essentially represents either 0 or more or 1 or more of the character that it follows (it always follows a character or group). For example, to match the donations above, we can use the pattern \d* to match any number of digits, but a tighter regular expression would be \d+ which ensures that the input string has at least one digit.

These quantifiers can be used with any character or special metacharacters, for example a+ (one or more a's), [abc]+ (one or more of any a, b, or c character) and .* (zero or more of any character).

Below are a few simple strings that you can match using both the star and plus metacharacters.
